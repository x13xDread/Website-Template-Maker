# Website-Template-Maker
Make custom built templates or build your own! Choose from options like:
- Adding up to ten pre-made Pages
- Pre-made CSS file linked on each page
- Pre-made JS file linked on each page
- Bootstrap already linked into your project
- A fully customizeable index page with the basics already there and links to each of those extra pages
- and hopefully more if I ever get around to it
